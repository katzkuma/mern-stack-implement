# A Project for Enhancing Web Application Development Skills

Hello ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º / ä½ å¥½ ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼, potential recruiters, teammates and employers. This repository serves as a record of my journey to improve my development skills after a career break. With four years of experience as a Java EE and ASP.NET web developer in Taiwan ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼, I've transitioned to Australia and developed a strong affinity for this remarkable place. My goal now is to enhance my skills to better fit future roles.

I'll be documenting my learning journey in this repository. Whether you're a recruiter, a potential teammate or employer, you'll find valuable insights about me here.
